# WORLD OF WARCRAFT CHARACTER LOOKUP
A look into OAuth 2.0 API integration. There's a fair amount of work that I could have done to optimize this project better had I found a way to work with non-depricated functions or had I used placeholder assets while the items were loading, but this got the job done well enough for me to be happy with it

## USE
Use the project by putting your character's name and region into their defined slots on the page. To clear all search results, click the [x] to the right of the main block of information. Add multiple characters to your search by searching for them sequentially. Swap back to a previously searched character by clicking their icon in the center section.

## RECOGNITION
This project was initially created as a programming test for EagleDream Technologies, and as such the visuals are (for the most part) based on their designs.
